												<h3>THE WEST</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Western Christainity.
												I love Jesus but I don't like Christians..............
												I think the Western world that brought Christianity to us still has a lot of explaining to do.........
												Cause I'm left in total confusion of what their religion speaks.
												A religion that sees polygamy as a sin but sees homosexuality as a freedom of sex choice (LGBTQ)‚ù§üíõüíöüíôüíú...
												A religion/country that preaches love but saves billions to get arsenals for war..........
												They helped us stop the killing of twins then taught us how comfortable doing abortion can be. Reminded our ladies that they too have a right to be the head in marriage, than being partners and taught men an easy way out, "Divorce".
												They gave us their church wedding as the one accepted by God and our traditional wedding as mere fulfillment, that some families will not allow you take your wife unless you wed her in the Church.. 
												Like I don't understand again.
												They gave us Bible, told us to close our eye let's pray, When we open our eyes, They took our land and left us with the Bible.

												<h3>RESTRICTED</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Restricted? No, It's very close I can see it very clear.................
												I can see it from here, just that I'm too emotional rather than logical, I thought being criticism is abuse, I felt correction is being belittled. 
												Restricted? Not at all, I'm just scared of the life beyond the walls, what happens if it's not as green as it looks?
												Restricted? No, no, no, just that my doctrine said it's not yet time to break in, I should wait on God's time. 
												Restricted? How? Just that my mum said it's arithmetic Progression 12345, I have to go to school, graduate, get a job, marry and do 9-5 everyday, Respectively, step by step . 
												Restricted? Not possible. Just that daddy said the medical line is the current money line now, So I have to switch and do it for dad, children obey your parents, 
												So I can't continue with my pen.  
												Restricted......... No I'm not, Just that people are yet to approve my choice. 
												I'm not RESTRICTED. 
												I'm.........NATURE!</p>

												<h3>TIME</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A time will come.......
												When people that live at the river bank will go thirsty, not that there will be no water, they will be looking at the river but guilt of the mind won't let them TAKE from it. 
												Time will come when people will value death more than life, because they are God over birth but slaves to death.
												Time will come when meekness will be weakness. 
												Time will come when the new broom will not sweep clear and the old broom won't know the corners of the room anymore. 
												Time will come when we will stop listening to the sweet melody of a music but keep busy with it's ineluctable sad lyrics. 
												Time will come when love will be a word of lies and weak people.
												Time will come when we will not hear the loud voice of joy but the silence of tears and agony. 
												TIME WILL COME WHEN FORGIVENESS WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE. 
												A TIME WILL COME WHEN THERE IS NO TIME. 
												UNLESS pure love happens, THIS TIME WILL SURELY COME

												<h3>LOVE</h3>
											</header>
											<p>LOVE
												LOVE is so messed up that sometimes we wish it doesn't exist. 
												It's one strong thing, I mean very strong and at the same time so soft and fragile.
												Sometimes we get caught up in some ideas that we fall in love with these ideas unknowingly, thinking we are in love with a person. 
												This idea of love having to be perfect and public worthy ruins our happiness and makes love look unreal. 
												This shit called love has no formula, pattern, strategy, rules or ways, it just happens and in the next minute you are becoming everything you preached against. 
												It's not like respect that must be reciprocated.....
												Yes!!! You can love someone genuinely and they will still not love you in return. 
												Lets just say, "LOVE" is one thing they forgot to add in the Wonders of the World.
